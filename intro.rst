What is a learning circle?
--------------------------

A learning circle is a study group of about 8 people that meets weekly at a physical location to complete an online course together. A facilitator is present to help with logistics and seed peer learning. Content expertise come from the online course and associated online community.

For more information, see the `P2PU facilitate page <https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/>`_.

Tools for learning circles
--------------------------

To help organize and run learning circles, we developed a set of online tools. These tools address the needs of three different groups:

#. Learners. The people taking the learning circles.
#. Facilitators. People facilitating individual learnig circles.
#. Organizers. People organizing several learning circles.

Learners can:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Browse learning circles available in their area.
* Sign up for a learning circle.
* RSVP for weekly learning circle meetings.
* Complete a survey on their experience taking the learning circle.

Facilitators can:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use a step by step dialog to guide them through creating a learning circle.
* See who signed up, when meetings are scheduled, who can come, etc.
* Send messages to learners.
* Customize the weekly reminders.
* Capture feedback after a meeting to gather and share reflections.
* Complete a survey on their experience facilitating a learning circle.

Organizers can:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* See feedback from facilitators on weekly meetings.
* See what meetings are happening each week.
* Receive weekly updates on what happened in learning circles the previous week.
* Manage learning circles and facilitators.


Using the tools
---------------

The tools are hosted online and can be accessed from `www.p2pu.org <https://www.p2pu.org>`_

All the source code is release under the MIT license and can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/p2pu/learning-circles/>`_.


Hosting your own instance
-------------------------

You need to be familiar with using the linux command line and setting up accounts on the web. You can find all the information you need to do so :doc:`here <installation>`.

If you're uncomfortable doing this on your own, or would simply prefer paying someone else to do this, you can reach out to P2PU and we can talk about setting this up for you.

You can always ask for support on `our forums <https://community.p2pu.org>`_ should you get stuck at any time.

For more information on using the tools from a facilitator or organizer perspective, you can skip over to :doc:`the facilitator user guide <facilitator>`
