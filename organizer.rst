Team Organizer Guide
====================

For cities and institutions that are running multiple learning circles, we offer team organizer functionality. As a team organizer, you get an overview of what is going on in learning circles run by facilitators across your team. Organizers are often facilitators, but this does not have to be the case.

Teams have to be manually added by P2PU. So if you aren't sure if you have one or have trouble accessing it, contact the P2PU team.

To get started, log into your dashboard - https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/

On Your Dashboard
------------------

Team Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you’re a team organizer, you’ll see an additional block on your Dashboard called Team Management. It includes a table of your current team members, your pending invitations, and a tab where you can invite new team members.

Adding Team Members
-------------------

Previously, team organizers could only invite team members individually by sending an invitation to their email address. Based on the organizer experiences we’ve observed, we added more options for adding team members. Now there are three ways an organizer can add team members:

Option 1: Email invitation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This works the same way as before, but now you’ll find the invitation form on the new Facilitator Dashboard in the Team Members block under the “Invite New Members” tab.

Option 2: Matching email domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If your team is associated with an organization that has its own email domain, we can save the email domain in your team settings so that any new facilitator with a validated matching email address will automatically receive an invitation to join your team. For example, if your team members all have staff emails such as *sharon@bigpubliclibrary.org*, you can set *bigpubliclibrary.org* as your team domain so that when someone with an email address like *nico@bigpubliclibrary.org* registers on the P2PU platform, they’ll get invited to join the team. If you want to use this method, please contact us directly to set the email domain.

Option 3: Invitation link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As an organizer, you can generate a unique link that allows anyone with the link to join your team. You can generate the link on Facilitator Dashboard in the Team Members block under the “Invite New Members” tab. You can also regenerate the link whenever you want, making any previous links inactive, or you can disable the invitation link altogether.


Teams Page and Organizer Profile
--------------------------------
The Teams Page provides a comprehensive listing of teams around the world, allows potential team members to connect with team organizers, and provides easy and direct access to a team’s learning circles. P2PU manages the Teams page so if you’d like to update your team’s listing please contact the P2PU team directly.

One aspect you can edit directly is your organizer profile that appears on the Teams page. On your Account Settings page, you can fill out your profile with a photo, bio, location, and link to your contact information. When you update your profile, the new information may take a few days to be reflected on the Teams page.


Weekly update
-------------

As a team organizer you will also receive a weekly update every Monday. This update with contain information about past, present, and upcoming meetings on your team, including learning circle reports, weekly feedback from facilitators, and information about who is signing up.
