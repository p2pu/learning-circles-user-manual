Team organizer guide
====================

For cities and institutions that are running multiple leanring circles, we offer team organizer functionality. As a team organizer, you get an overview of what is going on in learning circles run by facilitators across your team. Organizers are often facilitators, but this does not have to be the case. 

Teams have to be manually added by P2PU. So if you aren't sure if you have one or have trouble accessing it, contact the P2PU team.

To get started, log into your dashboard - https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/accounts/login/

Dashboard overview
------------------

At the top of your dashboard, there are 4 different tabs for organizsers to switch between: upcoming meetings, active learning circles, facilitators and invitations.

The **upcoming meetings** view gives you an overview of what learning circles are meeting this week. You can also see what is happening the previous week or the next week.
